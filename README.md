The goal of this program is to exercise at multiple inheritance. An artifact consists of an index, a creator and a year of creation. A masterpiece, which is a type of artifact, consists of a movement (impressionism, expressionism, naturalism) and a condition (bad, good, excellent). There are two types of masterpieces, paintings and sculptures. A painting consists of dimensions (length and width) and a technique (oil,aquarelle, tempera). A sculpture consists of volume and material (iron, stone, wood). The function auction takes as argument the desired movement and condition and evaluates the artifacts.
