# Artifact Java
Written in Java 1.8, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. The program needs exactly three integers as arguments (./artifact N mvmt cond). Specifically, N: the amount of artifacts, mvmt: The movement of the artifacts (0:Impessionism, 1:Expressionism, 2:Naturalism) and cond: The condition of the artifacts (0:Bad, 1:Good, 2:Excellent) Contains makefile: `make` to compile, `make clean` to delete object files and executable and `make run` to run program with default arguments. Goal of this program is to exercise at multiple inheritance. An artifact consists of an index, a creater and a year of creator. A masterpiece, which is a type of artifact, consists of a movement (impressionism, expressionism, naturalism) and a condition (bad, good, excellent). There are two types of masterpieces, paintings and sculptures. A painting consists of dimensions (length and width) and a technique (oil,aquarelle, tempera). A sculpture consists of volume and material (iron, stone, wood). The function auction takes as argument the desired movement and condition and evaluates the artifacts.
